# Reading remote sensing images into Python using Rasterio

[Rasterio](https://mapbox.github.io/rasterio/index.html) is a Python package developed by the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) team, meant to be a more user-friendly interface to the [Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)](http://www.gdal.org/). GDAL is an amazing open library that can tell other programs how to read and write raster and vector geospatial data. Most open-source remote sensing and GIS software and packages rely heavily on it (for example, [QGIS](www.qgis.org)).

This guide assumes you have and Anaconda environment set up with Rasterio, and that you have our set of sample imagery to work with. See the LINKPENDING setup section for details.
