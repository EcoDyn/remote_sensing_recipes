# Reading remote sensing images into Python using raster_io

[Rasterio](https://mapbox.github.io/rasterio/index.html) is a Python package developed by the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) team, meant to be a more user-friendly interface to the [Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)](http://www.gdal.org/). GDAL is an amazing open library that can tell other programs how to read and write raster and vector geospatial data. Most open-source remote sensing and GIS software and packages rely heavily on it (for example, [QGIS](www.qgis.org)).
