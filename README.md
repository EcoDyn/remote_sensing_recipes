# Remote Sensing taks using scriptable free languages: an ever-growing guide

This repository will document, including actual scripts, remote sensing recipes developed by the Ecosystem Dynamics Observatory to accomplish remote sensing and image processing taks, using R, Python and/or associated libraries.

## Image Input/Output

### [Reading images into Python using Rasterio](raster_io.md)

[Rasterio](https://mapbox.github.io/rasterio/index.html) is a Python package developed by the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) team, meant to be a more user-friendly interface to the [Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)](http://www.gdal.org/). GDAL is an amazing open library that can tell other programs how to read and write raster and vector geospatial data.

## Image Visualization

## Resampling and Subsetting

## Mathematical Operations

## Image Segmentation

## Feature Extraction

## Image Classification

## Post-Classification Tasks

## Example Files

We include in this repository a couple of remote sensing image files to be used for the recipes. They are tracked using Git Large File Storage.

## Installing required applications
