# Remote sensing tasks using scriptable free languages: an ever-growing guide

This repository will document, including actual scripts, remote sensing recipes developed by the Ecosystem Dynamics Observatory to accomplish remote sensing and image processing taks, using R, Python and/or associated libraries.

### Image Input/Output

#### [Reading images into Python and R](raster_io.md)

Examples of how to read image data into your working environment in Python and R.

### [Image Visualization](raster_vis.md)

### [Stacking, Resampling and Subsetting](raster_preprocess.md)

### Mathematical Operations

### Image Segmentation

### Feature Extraction

### Image Classification

### Post-Classification Tasks

### Example Files

We include in this repository a couple of remote sensing image files to be used for the recipes. They are tracked using Git Large File Storage.

### Installing required applications
